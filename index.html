  <h3> Who is Yangang?!</h3>
  <p>Yangang is a street dog saved from the street and been kept in the street dog centre. <br>
  She was brought to home from this facility at an age of 3 months! <br>
  The goal was to get rid of her frustration to people. She was very sensitive.<br>
  But as she has grown up, she has got back her smile! </b><br>

<h3>Ok. We know about tables, images, and headings. What about links?</h3>
<p>A link tag, or "a" tag, is an <b>inline element</b>. This means that when you include it in your code, it isn't going to force a new row like block elements do;
  it will fit into the rest of the line. Let's look at an example of what this looks like.
  <br>
  Ok, so we are currently still within our "p" element. Let's throw in link <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Notice how we're still in the same line?
  <p>A link will appear differently in HTML than a button will. This is what a <button>button looks like</button><br>
    BE AWARE! Buttons in HTML are intended to do something, not to take you somewhere. You'll notice that for buttons there is no href attribute;
    that's because buttons are meant to be targeted using JavaScript to make something happen. Your "a" tags are for links, and your "button" tag is for action.
